# OpenEndedGraphicAutograder
Using SigLIP as an image classifier and LLM calls to generate feedback for open-ended graphics programming assignments. Read more [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jmlof_S3xwMgfrKCMAt8zdcw_kD21a6jASn-sGWR0Do/edit?usp=sharing).

# Getting Started
Within this repository, you will find
1. A Demo [notebook](/Open_Ended_Graphics_Grading_Full_Code.ipynb)
   * This notebook contains a sample workflow in which our classifier predicts a flag and generates a subsequent response.
3. Raw Code
   * This includes the notebooks used for GPT comparison, Outlier Detection, and SigLIP classification of our flags.
